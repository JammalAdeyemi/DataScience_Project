"Fun and flexible work environment and an opportunity to learn how to run a business successfully."
"be prepared for constant changes, rules, errors, lack of support"
"Award-winning training. All the support you need if you haven't done this kind of work before."
"very long hours"
"Inclusive environment. Good salary and benefits. All managers are really good and helpful.The faster you learn you get trained in more responsibilities which makes you eligible for positions like managers."
"Moral is low. Trainers are not compensated. No perks as an employee. No true acknowledgement for hard workers. Micromanagers."
"Amazon is a great place to work I don't know what you're complaining about. They help you out with everything in life that you need and set you up for better. Great pay too."
"Worst company to work for, over work drivers and warehouse workers, don't care about safety regulations, treat workers like garbage for low rate. Needs a union asap"
"A lot of the time during the day it was very hot and had to bring your own water, there wasn't much of a lunch break at all and also fuel cost were very expensive"
"Prepare to drive lots of miles for work. Drive tons of miles and far distances from pickup points at times."
"They hire you within a week, decent pay if you work your full hours, the time off is good. Free lunch!"
"It was a great job, loved it there, the mangers care about your time. The work load is not that bad. Working in the kitchen was a breeze. Amazon fresh is a great job. Good Pay."
"Tasks are simple to do and make time go by quickly as long as you're working. Coworkers are fun to be around. Management is easygoing and open to help. Feel tired after working consecutive days. Flexible schedule, easy tasks, fun coworkers, helpful management"
"I truly do not recommend this job. Because Its really hard to get any shifts. Not worth your time so save your time and apply elsewhere. Team trainer gossips like she's still in high school and managers are non-existent. No shifts available, gossip co-workers, all on your own to solve customer issues, no benefits."
"People are super supportive & the environment here is so welcoming. As an Amazon marketing head, I've been managing advertisement campaigns and other day to day stuff. However, I get to meet & collaborate with experts from other niches such as Social Media marketing team, production& customer support team, and so on."
"You are a number not a individual. You will be used up and exhausted, upper management will take the achievements of yours as their own and you will be tired all the time. Upper management does not care, you will pay for their mistakes of others."
"Sometimes there are not a lot of shifts so beware if this is your primary source of income. Poor shift availability"
"Managers were easy to talk to and were always there to help. Company constantly had us upgrading our systems to ensure that our work was trouble-free and productive. 4 day shifts, growth opportunity, fair wage"
"Mandatory overtime around peak season"
"however unrealistic time scales and expectations compromising drivers safety has gotten worse over the recent years. Unrealistic and inexperienced management"
"Typical Day* Challenging, but always rewarding. What I've Learned? * Overcoming the challenges and trying New things. Management* Caring, Very Helpful and wants you to succeed in every area possible. Workplace Culture* It's culture moves around Fast Pace and Productivity and Innovation. The Most Enjoyable Part of The Job* Knowing being Rewarded in your good and leveling up to become Great in your Greatness. Benefits, Dental, Medical, Visual Insurance."
"What is the best part of working at the company? Flexible schedule. Voluntary time off. Paid time off. You get to pick what time off you like to use. You get to experience real team work."
"Unpaid time off."
"I really loved working at Amazon. After I had my son, it was the perfect thing for me to do to get those extra pounds off that I want it gone, but also it came with a lot of benefits like parties, contest and your own share of Amazon stocks."
"My advice? I would avoid it. The company gives no fucks about the warehouse employee experience. They will break you and replace you and sleep on their piles of money. If its a temp gig and you don't care about moving up or advancing, sure. But I would not aim for a career there"
"It's okay as a job in-between jobs but if you have any goals or expectations for your life, don't stay long. It's draining and demoralising."
"Workplace culture is a toxic blame culture and burnout is extremely likely, in a very short period of time, so not many people last over 2 years in management roles etc. but if you want to climb the ladder â€¦ Iâ€™d say there are certainly better companies out there for development."
"Staff don't care about me, but I didn't care about the job."
"I also worked in one during peak and it was 11 hour days 4 days a week, with two separate 35 minute breaks. so after breaks it was a 50 hour work week, good pay!"
"They did have compulsory overtime to do the 5th day"
"I had to work additional days that was not mentioned in my contract. Against the law no doubt. Told them to F off and left. Just after Christmas I got a call from them saying Amazon was impressed with my work or some shit and offered me a full time job even though I left how I did. I didn't take It and told them to piss off."
"Treated horribly by management. Had too much self-respect to stay any longer."
"What a god awful place."
"I've never seen it on any team I've ever been on. I know a few specific people at Amazon who work themselves to death So when it happens, it's more of a personal issue rather than a work 80 hours or we fire you issue. I imagine that kind of thing happens in isolated cases. There are a ton of things I don't like about this company."
"Trying to get out. I've been here for almost 2 years and it's really getting to me. These facilities are riddled with poor upper management, drama, and politics. To make matters worse, internal promotions are not very compensating."
"Union busting is disgusting! Even though we might not work at the air hub, working people must fight back against Amazonâ€™s bullying tactics of firing workers who dare to fight for a fair wage and safe conditions!"
"I gotta find a different job Amazon puts too much fucking work load on ppl because these cheap bitches donâ€™t want to hire more ppl thereâ€™s 36 people on my team only 6 are women including me discriminatory AS FUCK ppl piss in bottles on the road cuz we donâ€™t get time for breaks"
"Working at Amazon was so fun, I worked with NaniðŸ’“ in packing, my mom worked there too then I met Miguel, had so many cool work friends and my managers loved us three cuz we were fast. We used to compete in packing LOL just reminiscing Aug 2021-feb of last year hehe"
"Working at amazon is the easiest thing Iâ€™ve ever done, getting paid for doing nothing rn"
"@JeffBezos I am working for you boss! I've been to three Amazon so far. Thanks for always helping me!"
"Stepping down from running the San Diego studio at Amazon Games. I have loved working for Christoph. Our San Diego team is incredible and the Games leadership is so talented. Canâ€™t wait to see what the future brings for the team."
"Thrilled to announce that I'm joining Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a Solutions Architect. ðŸš€ 
A dream come true to work with the biggest giant in the cloud industry @awscloud."
"If anyone is interested in working for Amazonâ€¦ DONT! Theyâ€™re selfish and only care for the company and not its employees. @amazon is below level as a company to its clients and employees. Theyâ€™re all about secrets and mysteries without explanations. Simply out, they donâ€™t care!"
"I can honestly say that the work culture is not great. They want you working outside work hours because they cannot manage tasks efficiently. People barely have any personal lives, they only talk about work or the weather. People send mails at 3 am. so unrealistically high, I feel burnout constantly."
"I am going to start making more money working at Amazon I am so hyped"
"Competitive salaries."
"Working for @amazon as a driver in 2023 I make about Â£4.30 p/h
#moderndayslavery"
"I am exited to share that today I am joining the amazing Amazon Comprehend team! ðŸ¥³ðŸ™‚ I hope I can from all my amazing new colleagues and contribute to the common efforts."
"Micromanagers run the place. Culture is awful. A typical day lasts 12 hours."
"I really highly don't recommend this position, especially if you are a woman. Women at amazon, especially in operations, are not regarded as humans with brains."
"However, I do have a really good manager which helps the situation a lot."
"This company is the worst company I ever worked for as far as leadership, no holidays, over work managers, no respect."
"I spent 2 years working at Amazon as an Area manager. Will hire you very quickly"
"Turnover was insane. Lots of throwing people under the bus and not caring about peoples lives. No lunch breaks, Weird working hours"
"Everything about Amazon is pretty fun. It can be hard work sometimes, but Amazon is a place that continues to raise the bar with talent and expectations"
"long hours become draining"
"They will exploite you. No important skills to learn. Everyone will stab you in the back."
"Too much work pressure, makes employees leave within 6 months."
"Excellent bennifits"
"The company tends to be focused more on quantity than quality. and it is easy to feel like youâ€™re just a number there. The expectations tend get increasingly out of reach to the point where the only way you can meet their expectations is by taking short cuts"
"you got paid breaks. when I worked there they didn't time you when it came to your bathroom break like I read. they gave out alot of vto plus during holidays etc they would give out things to employees to show they cared. paid breaks, free things around holidays, pto every 3 months, vto atleaset 1 time a week."
"Best place to work, amazing benefits, and fun atmosphere. Safest place ever worked. They truly care about their employees and go above and beyond for their employees in everyway."
"it was horrible. would not recommend to anyone. felt so miserable working there, wouldn't go back. the other workers there acted like it was high school"
"It was a great place to work it has lots and lots of benefits and it is very easy to make extra money at amazon. Especially with their pto system, it is very cool."
"You are not micro managed, you manage your own time. Awesome benefits, I enjoy my co-workers. You can easily advance and transfer within the company. After a year Amazon pays for school ðŸ’¯ percent upfront with certain selected schools in the program. Overall Amazon is great place to work, and have many other benefits. The ages are from 18 to ages over 70. Weekly pay, free schooling after a year, great benefits, and I love my 4 days off."
"The graveyard shift, harassment, low pay and prison feel like is not worth it."
"Very easy to get hired if there is a start date available. One week training period with majority of work tracked for rate and time off task. Very easy job."
"Great extra job because of flexibility. Work is mentally easy. Fun place to work with music, upbeat atmosphere. Flexible."
"Not hard to stand out if you put the work in and make yourself open to learn and grow. Management was always receptive to making sure things got done safely and we even tried to have fun while we worked towards our goals. Very structured environment"
"Decent hours, benefits, paid holidays, paid days off and more. I prefer the 4 ten hour days more than 5 eight hour days though. Good place to work for sure."
"people leave, you start from 0 every time, no stability, you can't develop any relationships because you have to work non-stop and people leave, if something goes wrong, it's your fault, your inbox is constantly full, if you get something done, then they give you more work, if you push back and say hey, haven't got time, then the university graduates that you work with who studied anthropology and started 2 months ago look at you like you are some kind of a criminal, unprofessional bloke who constantly complains about workload. You are just a number at the end of the day."
"Working from home 4 days a week, isn't bad and the pay is good for what we do."
"I have no complaints other than I find it to be difficult for managers to hold poor performers accountable; this makes it more difficult on the team as as a whole. Accountability for poor performers = NONE"
"From culture to perks to work, everything is great!"
"No appraisal or promotion"
"Compensation is decent, and you will get a chance to learn new things"
"Micro management while on remove, work is validated by click per hours"
"It was great. Excellent work culture. Flexible. Work life balance is perfect. Hiring is good. pto its Standard. Good amenities. Best place to start career. Overall excellent. Free food, amenities, campus, flexibility."
"Good place to work with good peers and helpful managers."
"Salary should be a little more"
"The company has excellent work life balance and have scope to learn a new skill and can take ownership of team level tasks."
"Good work life balanced and culture."
"Salary is too low"
"The pay is below average for the amount of work your do, No job security"
"no time for family, private life or else. Favoritism on the highest levels, incompetence is the finest one."
"You have rates you have to reach. Not very forgiving"
"personally this job was not for me at all. Breaks were too short and the gap between them were very long. Long hours"
"We had mandatory overtime, which led to NO work/ life balance."
"Long night shifts, Transport does not run from 8am to 6pm, Leadership can be cliquey."
"After pandemic they started putting pressure on employee. They are so Customer centric that they forget that the empoyees are also human.They make you do things which you are not comfortable with under the cross skill policy. Pressure, Donkey work"
"The opportunities to raise through the ladder are low and are extremely tough with very high competition."
"Did not enjoy working here. No life work balance."
"They train you for a specific department then out of the blue decide to move you to a whole new department with little to no training. No support from management to team leads."
"however the longer you are there the more you feel like a number and unappreciated and underpaid due to the work load."
"Management isn't always readily available when you need help."
"The management/ managers are not good and doesn't take care of employees. Work-life balance is worst. Plus no job guarantee. No job guarantee and worst management."
"there no team feeling, and coworkers will throw you under the bus at the first opportunity"
"They should pay more for the amount of work they have you do. One of the managers was a creep"
"No work-life balance because most shifts were unpredictable. People was rarely given time for lunch/ bathroom breaks."
