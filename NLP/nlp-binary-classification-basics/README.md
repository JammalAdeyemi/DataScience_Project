# NLP Project for Beginners on Text Processing and Classification

## Project Overview

Natural Language Processing, often abbreviated as NLP, gives the ability to machines to understand, read, and get meaningful insights from human language. Basically, NLP is the automatic handling of human languages. Nowadays, NLP is prospering due to the large availability of data and computational power. NLP has dug down its routes from healthcare, media, finance to human resources. It is growing with each coming day.

## Aim
