# DataSciencePortfolio
A collection of selected data science projects to demonstrate my skill sets, knowledge, and what I find interesting. All datasets were gotten from kaggle/UCI.

## Contents
* Data Analysis: Analyzing Datasets to develop different visualization and output meaningful insights.
* Supervised Learning: This contains all my `Classification` and `Regression` projects.
* Unsupervised Learning: Using different unsupervised learning algorithms to work on different projects like `Topic Modelling`, `Market Basking`, `K-Means Clustering` etc.
* Probability: Working on a case study I saw online, which allowed me to focus on different probability subtopics like `Binomial`, `Possion` etc
* NLP: Projecs on different NLP methods
* Deep Learning: Focusing on Tensorflow to work on different case studies

## In Progress
* Unsupervised Learning projects
* Deep Learning
* Natural Language Processing(NLP)
* Recommender system
* Time Series
